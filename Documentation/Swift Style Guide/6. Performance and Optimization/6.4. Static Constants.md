# Static Constants

It's best practice to define constants as `static` properties within an object instead of global variables.

```swift
struct AppConstants {
    static let apiKey: String = "..."
    static let privacyPolicyURL: String = "..."
    static let termsAndConditionsURL: String = "..."
}
```

If these `static` constants are commonly declared throughout the codebase (such as UI models), there's no need to retain them in memory permanently. We can instead make them computed properties, which optimizes memory usage without sacrificing performance or meaning. By computing the value on-demand, we reduce the amount of memory needed to store these constants, which is especially beneficial in resource-constrained environments.

Not Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home UI Model
@Uninitializable
struct HomeUIModel {
    static let imageViewDimension: CGFloat = 50
    static let stackViewSpacing: CGFloat = 10
    static let primaryButtonMarginHorizontal: CGFloat = 20
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home UI Model
@Uninitializable
struct HomeUIModel {
    static var imageViewDimension: CGFloat { 50 }
    static var stackViewSpacing: CGFloat { 10 }
    static var primaryButtonMarginHorizontal: CGFloat { 20 }
}
```
