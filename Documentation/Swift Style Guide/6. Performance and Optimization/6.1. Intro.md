# Intro

Performance and optimization are important, because they directly affect the user experience of an app. In today's fast-paced world, users expect apps to be responsive, fast, and efficient. If an app is slow or unresponsive, users may become frustrated and abandon the app, leading to a loss of customers.

In addition to user experience, performance and optimization also affect the scalability and cost of running an app. If an app is not optimized, it may consume more resources than necessary, leading to higher hosting costs and potentially making it difficult to scale the app.

`Swift` is designed to be a high-performance language, and it offers a number of features and optimizations that can help developers write efficient code. By taking advantage of these features and writing performant code, developers can ensure that their apps provide a great user experience and are scalable and cost-effective to run.
