# Private Members

To improve performance inside a `class`, `struct`, and `enum`, it's important to declare all members that are not part of an interface as `private`. This allows the compiler to check for polymorphism at compile time, which can significantly improve performance.

Using the `private` access modifier also ensures that these members are not called unintentionally from other parts of the code, which can help prevent bugs and improve code maintainability. By keeping the implementation details hidden from other parts of the code, it becomes easier to change or refactor the declaration without affecting other parts of the program.
