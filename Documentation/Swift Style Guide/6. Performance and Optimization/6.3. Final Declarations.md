# Final Declarations

It's a good practice to mark all declarations as `final`, unless there is a specific need to override them. The `final` keyword allows the compiler to use `static` dispatch, which improves performance.

Not Preferred:

```swift
class NonParentClass {
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
final class NonParentClass {
    ...
}
```

Furthermore, marking a `class` as `final` ensures that it cannot be subclassed, preventing unintended changes and enhancing the stability of the codebase.

Not Preferred:


```swift
class Parent {
    func overridableMethod() { ... }
    
    func nonOverridableMethod() { ... }
}
```

Preferred:


```swift
class Parent {
    func overridableMethod() { ... }
    
    final func nonOverridableMethod() { ... }
}
```
