## Intro

Good API design is important because it can greatly impact the usability and maintainability of a software system. A well-designed API provides a clear and intuitive interface for developers to interact with a software system, making it easier for them to understand how to use the system and reducing the likelihood of errors or bugs.

Additionally, a well-designed API can make it easier to add new features or make changes to the system, as it provides a clear separation between the underlying implementation and the interface presented to developers. This can lead to faster development times, easier collaboration between developers, and ultimately a better user experience for the end user.

## Apple API Design Guidelines

The following is a summary of official [API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines).

#### Fundamentals

- Clarity at the point of use is the most important goal
- Clear code is better than a compact one
- Write documentation

#### Promote Clear Usage

- Include all the words needed to avoid ambiguity
- Omit needless words
- Use variable and parameter names based on roles, not their type constraints
- Compensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter’s role

#### Strive for Fluent Usage

- Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases
- Begin names of factory methods with “make”
- The first argument to initializer and factory methods calls should not form a phrase starting with the base name
- Name functions and methods according to their side-effects
    - When the operation is naturally described by a verb, use the verb’s imperative for the mutating method and apply the "ed" or "ing" suffix to name its nonmutating counterpart
    - When the operation is naturally described by a noun, use the noun for the nonmutating method and apply the "form" prefix to name its mutating counterpart
    - Uses of Boolean methods and properties should read as assertions about the receiver when the use is nonmutating
    - Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns
    - Protocols that describe a capability should be named using the suffixes "able", "ible", or "ing"
    - The names of other types, properties, variables, and constants should read as nouns

#### Use Terminology Well

- Avoid obscure terms if a more common word conveys meaning just as well
- Stick to the established meaning—don't surprise an expert, or confuse a beginner
- Avoid abbreviations
- Embrace precedent—don’t optimize terms for the total beginner at the expense of conformance to existing culture
