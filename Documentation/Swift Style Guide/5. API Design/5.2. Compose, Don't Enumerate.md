# Compose, Don't Enumerate

In some cases, an API can be greatly improved or made more flexible by choosing to use `structs` instead of `enums`. Generally, `enums` should only be used over `structs` when the `case`s represent closely related values or states, such as cardinal directions or device orientation. Using an `enum` simply to enforce coupling can introduce code bloat or other issues in the future.

We can observe this practice in recent versions of `SwiftUI`, where many types that seem to be `enum`s, such as `Alignment`, are actually `struct`s.

A simple mechanism that allows for seamless exchange between `struct`s and `enum`s is the fact that, API-wise, there is no difference between an `enum` and a `struct` with static factory initializers.

In many cases, composition is preferred over enumeration. They will be covered over next several chapters.
