## Problem

Very often do I see implementations, where forced coupling is being applied.

```swift
enum Endpoint {
    case list(page: Int, count: Int)
    case details(id: Int)
    
    var path: String {
        switch self {
        case .list: "list"
        case .details: "details"
        }
    }
    
    var url: String {
        "https://somewebsite.com/api/\(path)"
    }
    
    func makeRequest() -> URLRequest { 
        ... 
    }
}
```

or

```swift
enum ScreenType {
    case list
    case details
}

struct ScreenFactory {
    func make(_ screen: Screen) -> UIViewController {
        switch screen {
        case .list:
            return ...
            
        case .details:
            return ...
        }
    }
}
```

It's important to avoid tightly coupling declarations just because an app has two endpoints or screens. As an app's scope increases, the number of `case`s in an `enum` could also grow, leading to unnecessary bloat.

Additionally, using an `enum` can limit the flexibility of an API. For example, if you wanted to make the `path` property of `Endpoint.details` dynamic based on a `Bool` flag, how would you modify a shared `url` property?

## Solution with the Composition

All of these problems can be solved with the composition.

```swift
protocol EndpointProtocol {
    var path: String { get }
    var url: String { get } 
    
    func makeRequest() -> URLRequest
}

extension EndpointProtocol {
    var url: String {
        "https://somewebsite.com/api/\(path)"
    }
}

struct ListEndpoint: EndpointProtocol {
    let page: Int
    let count: Int
    let someCondition: Bool
    
    var path: String {
        if someCondition {
            "list"
        } else {
            "new_list"
        }
    }
}

...
```

or

```swift
protocol ScreenFactoryProtocol {
    func make(_ screen: Screen) -> UIViewController
}

struct ListScreenFactory: ScreenFactoryProtocol {
    let someCondition: Bool
    
    func make(_ screen: Screen) -> UIViewController {
        if someCondition {
            return ...
        } else {
            return ...
        }
    }
}

...
```
