# Compose, Don't Enumerate: To Introduce Private Instances

## Problem

`private` access modifier cannot be directly applied to individual `case`s of an `enum`. This could be particularly useful if you'd like to allow different configurations, but restrict the visibility of possible instances.

```swift
public enum Configuration {
    case first
    private case second // Error
}

public var configuration: Configuration = .second
```

## Solution with the Composition

By converting an `enum` to a `struct` we can introduce `private` instances.

```swift
public protocol ConfigurationProtocol {
    ...
}

public struct FirstConfiguration: ConfigurationProtocol {
    ...
}

private struct SecondConfiguration: ConfigurationProtocol {
    ...
}

public var configuration: ConfigurationProtocol = SecondConfiguration()

```

It's important to keep in mind, that the introduction of a `protocol` type allows for new, un-intended types to be introduced. This can introduce potential complications, as types that were not initially intended to be used with the `protocol` might start conforming to it. This can result in unexpected behavior or violations of the original design intent. To mitigate this, it's crucial to carefully consider the design and scope of your problem.
