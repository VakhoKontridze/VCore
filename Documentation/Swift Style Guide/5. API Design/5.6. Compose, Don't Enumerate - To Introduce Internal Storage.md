# Compose, Don't Enumerate: To Introduce Internal Storage

When dealing with an `enum`, it might become necessary to introduce internal storage or logic. In such cases, it can be beneficial to convert the `enum` to a `struct`. By doing so, you can easily add stored properties and methods, which can be helpful when dealing with complex data structures.

Converting an `enum` to a `struct` is straightforward and involves creating a `static` factory initializer for each case. Additionally, you will need to define stored properties in the `struct` to hold any data required by the cases. Once you have made this conversion, you can freely add methods and properties to the `struct` as needed.

```swift
let someConfiguration: Configuration = .first

public struct Configuration {
    var _configuration: _Configuration
    
    var internalStorage: Int?

    init(configuration: _Configuration) {
        self._configuration = configuration
    }

    public static var first: Self {
        self.init(
            configuration: .first
        )
    }

    public static var second: Self {
        self.init(
            configuration: .second
        )
    }
}

enum _Configuration {
    case first
    case second
}

func doSomethingInternally(with configuration: Configuration) {
    var configuration = configuration

    if someCondition() {
        configuration.internalStorage = 10
    }
    
    ...
    
    if let value = configuration.internalStorage {
        ...
    }
}
```
