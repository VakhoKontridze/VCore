# Compose, Don't Enumerate: To Deviate from Standard Configuration

## Problem

Consider a screen that can be configured, and it's used in two different ways in the app, namely `first` and `second`. It may seem tempting to use an `enum` for this purpose, because it allows properties to be declared and handled with `switch-case` statements. However, this can lead to a bloated codebase as the app scope increases.

```swift
enum ScreenConfiguration {
    case first
    case second

    var hasHeaderTitle: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .first: return true
        case .second: return false
        }
    }

    var hasFooterTitle: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .first: return true
        case .second: return false
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution with the Composition

In cases like this, it may be better to use composition instead of `enum`. This allows for more flexibility and scalability in the long run, as new use cases can be added without cluttering the existing code. Additionally, using a `struct` allows for each usage to have its own set of properties, instead of sharing the same properties like in an `enum`. This can be especially useful if one usage requires a property that the other doesn't, or we want to deviate from standard configuration.

```swift
struct ScreenConfiguration {
    var hasHeaderTitle: Bool
    var hasFooterTitle: Bool

    static var first: Self {
        .init(
            hasHeaderTitle: true,
            hasFooterTitle: true
        )
    }

    static var second: Self {
        .init(
            hasHeaderTitle: false,
            hasFooterTitle: false
        )
    }
}

extension ScreenConfiguration {
    static var firstDeviated: Self {
        var configuration: Self = .first
        configuration.hasFooterTitle = false
        return configuration
    }
}
```
