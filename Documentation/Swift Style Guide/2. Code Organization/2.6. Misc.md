## Protocol Members with Identical Signature

Earlier, we discussed the recommendation to implement `protocol` conformance inside the main declaration. However, when a normal property and a `protocol` member, or members of multiple `protocol`s share signatures, it can be challenging to organize the code. Declaring the same member multiple times is not possible, as it will result in an error. To address this issue, one approach is to declare the member only once and comment out the other duplicate declarations. This technique helps with code organization and clarity, ensuring that readers can easily find `protocol` members without confusion.

```swift
// MARK: - Some Protocol
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var someProperty: Int { get set }
    var otherProperty: Int { get set }
}

// MARK: - Some Struct
struct SomeStruct: SomeProtocol {
    // MARK: Properties
    var someProperty: Int = 10
    
    // MARK: Some Protocol
    //var someProperty: Int
    var otherProperty: Int = 20
}
```
