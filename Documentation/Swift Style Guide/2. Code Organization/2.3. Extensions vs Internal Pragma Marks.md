# Extensions vs Internal Pragma Marks

Extensions are a powerful `Swift` feature that allows us to add functionality to a type outside of its main declaration. While extensions can be useful in certain situations, they should not be overused to break up a type into self-contained blocks of functionality. In many cases, internal sections created with pragma marks may provide a more clear and concise way to organize code. 

It is important to note that extensions can be particularly useful when working with third-party libraries or system frameworks, as they allow us to add functionality without modifying the original code. Additionally, extensions can help to keep related functionality together and make it easier to navigate and modify the code. However, if extensions are overused or misapplied, they can actually decrease code readability and make it more difficult to maintain over time. 

Not Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home View Controller
final class HomeViewController: UIViewController {
    // MARK: ...
    ...
}

// MARK: - UI Table View Delegate
extension HomeViewController: UITableViewDelegate {
    ...
}

// MARK: - UI Table View DataSource
extension HomeViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home View Controller
final class HomeViewController:
    UIViewController, 
    UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource
{
    // MARK: ...
    ...

    // MARK: UI Table View Delegate
    ...

    // MARK: UI Table View DataSource
    ...
}
````

In summary, while extensions can be a valuable tool in the right situations, they should be used judiciously and in accordance with best practices for code organization and readability.
