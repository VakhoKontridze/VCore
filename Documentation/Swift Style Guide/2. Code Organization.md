## Intro

Modern software has become bloated. Codebases are harder to read. Collaboration, and further modification of the code may not follow the same style, or place additional functionality in appropriate place, since code has no standardized layout and sections. 

Using pragma marks can help with code organization and readability.

```swift
// MARK: - Home View Controller
final class HomeViewController: UIViewController {
    // MARK: Subviews
    ...

    // MARK: Properties
    ...

    // MARK: Lifecycle
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setUp()
    }

    // MARK: Setup
    private func setUp() {
        setUpView()
        addSubviews()
        setUpLayout()
        setUpNavigationBar()
    }
    
    private func setUpView() {
        view.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
    }

    private func addSubviews() {
        ...
    }

    private func setUpLayout() {
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            ...
        ])
    }
    
    private func setUpNavigationBar() {
        navigationItem.title = "Home"
    }

    // MARK: ...
}
```

Compartmentalizing types and files into blocks of functionality also provide a guidelines for future modification. If one decides to implement `viewWillAppear(_:)` method, there already is a predefined place to implement it at.

## Standardization

Pragma marks that set off a top-level types should be written as `// MARK: - Some Section`, while nested pragma marks as `// MARK: Some Internal Section`. Dashed pragma marks add a visual separator line in code, that also appears in mini-map and jump bar.

For simple types and `protocol`s, no internal compartmentalization is needed:

```swift
// MARK: - User
struct User {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
}
```

```swift
// MARK: - Traffic Light State
enum TrafficLightState {
    case red
    case green
    case yellow
}
```

When new functionality, other than properties or cases are implemented, additional sections should be introduced:

```swift
// MARK: - User
struct User {
    // MARK: Properties
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
    
    // MARK: Initializers
    init(fromJSON json: [String: Any?]) {
        ...
    }
}
```

```swift
// MARK: - Traffic Light State
enum TrafficLightState {
    // MARK: Cases
    case red
    case green
    case yellow
    
    // MARK: Properties
    var nextState: Self {
        ...
    }
}
```

Order of the sections should follow these rules:

- In types and `protocol`s, we can declare properties first, then initializers, and then everything else
- Setup section, that runs once during initialization or some initial lifecycle, comes before configuration section 
- In `enum`s, `case` section comes first
- In `UIViewController`s, we can declare subviews section above properties. Also, lifecycle method section is the first addition functionality.
- In `View`s, body section comes after properties and initializers

## Extensions vs Internal Pragma MARKs

Extensions are `Swift` feature, that allows us to break out a functionality outside the main declaration. In most cases, extensions shouldn't be used to break up a type into self contained blocks of functionalities. They provide no benefits over internal sections created with pragma marks, and subsequently, readability is not improved.

Not Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home View Controller
final class HomeViewController: UIViewController {
    // MARK: ...
    ...
}

// MARK: - UI Table View Delegate
extension HomeViewController: UITableViewDelegate {
    ...
}

// MARK: - UI Table View DataSource
extension HomeViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home View Controller
final class HomeViewController:
    UIViewController, 
    UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource
{
    // MARK: ...
    ...

    // MARK: UI Table View Delegate
    ...

    // MARK: UI Table View DataSource
    ...
}
````

## When Not to Use Extensions

Following up the previous point, `protocol` conformance should be implemented in the main declaration. There are some reasons for this rule:

#### They Are Not Always Feasible

If we would like to implement a property from `protocol` as a stored property, we have to defer to type's main declaration again. This requires splitting up members, and subsequently reducing the readability, which is what we aimed to improve. We can achieve the same result by implementing the `protocol` inside the main declaration, and compartmentalizing members under with an internal pragma mark.

Consider the following `protocol`:

```swift
// MARK: - Game Character Protocol
protocol GameCharacterProtocol {
    var id: String { get }
    var health: Int { get set }
}
```

Not Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - NPC
struct NPC {
    // MARK: Properties
    ...

    // MARK: Game Character Protocol Leftovers...?
    var health: Int = 100
}

// MARK: - Game Character Protocol
extension SomeStruct: GameCharacterProtocol {
    var id: String { ... }
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - NPC
struct NPC: GameCharacterProtocol {
    // MARK: Properties
    ...

    // MARK: Game Character Protocol
    var id: String { ... }
    var health: Int = 100
}
```

#### They Make Declaration's Role Harder to Understand

Splitting type's functionality into extensions that conform to `protocol`s makes it hard to understand everything that the type does. Alternately, we can list all `protocol`s alongside the type declaration, and save ourselves from endless scrolling and mental note-taking.

```swift
final class HomePresenter<View, Router, Interactor>:
    HomePresentable,
    WalkthroughDelegate,
    SideMenuDelegate,
    ItemPickerDelegate,
    ImagePickerDelegate
    where
        View: HomeViewable,
        Router: HomeRoutable,
        Interactor: HomeInteractive
{
    ...
}
```

#### They Permit Splitting Types Across Files

When we split types into extensions, we give ourselves an option of moving some of them into separate files. For instance, we may declare a `HomeViewController` in one file, and conform to `UITableView` `protocol`s in separate files. By doing this, readability is severely decreased, and we are again forced to jump from file to file, and partake in endless mental note-taking.

#### They May Decrease Performance

Static dispatch is faster than a dynamic dispatch, and should be utilized whenever possible.

Members declared within a non-`final` `class` execute using a dynamic dispatch. While members declared in an extension execute using a static dispatch. If extra performance is required, this may seem as a viable option.

```swift
class Parent {
    func doSomething() { ... } // Dynamic dispatch (table)
}

extension Parent {
    func doAnotherThing() { ... } // Static dispatch
}
```

However, there are pitfalls to this approach. Overriding methods from a subclass that are declared within an extension requires an `@objc` annotation. These methods execute via dynamic dispatch. They decrease performance, since message-based dynamic dispatch is slower than a table-based one.

```swift
class Parent {
    func doSomething() { ... } // Dynamic dispatch (table)
}

extension Parent {
    @objc func doAnotherThing() { ... } // Dynamic dispatch (message)
}

class Child: Parent {
    override func doSomething() { ... }
    
    override func doAnotherThing() { ... }
}
```

However, if you do not intend for the extension methods to be overridden, mark them as `final`. But, marking them as `final` eliminates the need for an extension. These methods can simply be moved to the main declaration.

```swift
class Parent {
    func doSomething() { ... } // Dynamic dispatch (table)
    
    final func doAnotherThing() { ... } // Static dispatch
}
```

## When to Use Extensions

#### To Use Compile Flags

Extensions should be used when the functionality cannot be implemented inside the main declaration.

Consider the following type:

```swift
struct GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled<Value> {
    let enabled: Value
    let pressed: Value
    let disabled: Value
}
```

In order to implement a functionality for `UIKit`-based devices, we need to write an import. This can only be done inside an extension.

```swift
#if canImport(UIKit)

import UIKit

extension GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled {
    public static var clearUIColors: GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled<UIColor> {
        .init(
            enabled: .clear,
            pressed: .clear,
            disabled: .clear
        )
    }
}

#endif
```

#### To Provide Type Constraints

Extensions should be used when the functionality cannot be implemented inside the main declaration.

In order to provide a type constraints to a generic type, an extension must be used.

```swift
extension GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled: Hashable where Value: Hashable {}

extension GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled: Equatable where Value: Equatable {}

extension GenericStateModel_EnabledPressedDisabled: Comparable where Value: Comparable {
    public static func < (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool {
        ...
    }
}
```

#### To Extend Types and Protocols from Other Modules

Adding functionality to types from another modules can only be done via extensions.

```swift
extension Array {
    subscript(safe index: Int) -> Element? {
        guard index >= 0, index < count else { return nil }
        return self[index]
    }
}

```

#### To Extend Types and Protocols from Other Files

Even though it was mentioned earlier that types should not be broken across files, sometimes, it's convenient to do itâ€”such as, when the functionality inside the extension doesn't have to be exposed beyond `fileprivate`/`private`.

For instance, writing an extension with `fileprivate` member of one type, that is then called from the extension of another type.

## Misc

#### Protocol Members with Identical Signature

It was discussed earlier that `protocol` conformance should be implemented inside the main declaration.

But how do we organize code, if a normal property and a member of a `protocol`, or members of multiple `protocol`s share signatures? We obviously cannot declare same member twice.

To help with organization and clarity, one approach is to declare members multiple times, treat first one as an actual declaration, and comment out the rest. This ensures that no questions will be asked when looking for `protocol` members.

```swift
// MARK: - Some Protocol
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var someProperty: Int { get set }
    var otherProperty: Int { get set }
}

// MARK: - Some Struct
struct SomeStruct: SomeProtocol {
    // MARK: Properties
    var someProperty: Int = 10
    
    // MARK: Some Protocol
    //var someProperty: Int
    var otherProperty: Int = 20
}
```
