## Intro

Modern software has become rather complex. Codebases are harder to read. In most cases, readability and clarity, without a doubt, has become the most important quality in a code. That's why styles or approaches that give more context and clarity at the call site should be preferred over approaches that infer or hide them.

## Golden Path

#### Clarity

Linear, un-indented code is preferred over nested `if` conditionals, where `else`, or fallback cases are mixed in with the main logic of the block. Preconditions should be used to guard against failures. If those conditions succeed, logic can continue.

Given an error:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case returnedWithError
    case invalidResponse
    case invalidData
}
```

Not Preferred:

```swift
func fetchData(
    ...,
    completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void
) {
    let request: URLRequest = ...
    
    let task: URLSessionDataTask = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request, completionHandler: { (data, response, error) in
        if error != nil {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.returnedWithError))

        } else {
            if
                let response,
                let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
                (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode)
            {
                if let data {
                    completion(.success(data))
                    
                } else {
                    completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidData))
                }
                
            } else {
                completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidResponse))
            }
        }
    })
    
    task.resume()
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
func fetchData(
    ...,
    completion: @escaping (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void
) {
    let request: URLRequest = ...
    
    let task: URLSessionDataTask = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request, completionHandler: { (data, response, error) in
        if error != nil {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.returnedWithError))
            return
        }
        
        guard
            let response,
            let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
            (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode)
        else {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidResponse))
            return
        }
        
        guard let data else {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidData))
            return
        }
        
        completion(.success(data))
    })
    
    task.resume()
}
```

#### When Failure Blocks Should Be Used

`guard` statements should be used to check preconditions. If those conditions fail, logic cannot continue.

#### When Failure Blocks Should Not Be Used

`guard` statements should not be used to check non-preconditions, such as a piece of code that's part of the main logic.

Not Preferred:

```swift
extension Set {
    mutating func toggle(
        _ element: Element
    ) {
        guard !contains(element) else {
            remove(element)
            return
        }
    
        insert(element)
    }
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
extension Set {
    mutating func toggle(
        _ element: Element
    ) {
        if contains(element) {
            remove(element)
        } else {
            insert(element)
        }
    }
}
```

## Function Naming

#### Clarity at the Call Site

Functions should be named in a way that they introduce clarity at the call site.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func add(_ observer: NSObject, for keyPath: String) { ... }

add(self, for: "contentSize")
```

Preferred:

```swift
func addObserver(_ observer: NSObject, forKeyPath keyPath: String) { ... }

addObserver(self, forKeyPath: "contentSize")
```

#### Delegate Methods

Methods from the same delegate should have a standardized prefix. This makes it easier to identify which methods belong to which `protocol`.

Not Preferred:

```swift
protocol ItemPickerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didSelectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    func didDeselectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)

    func didCommitItems(at indexes: [Int], sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    
    func didTapCloseButton(sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
protocol ItemPickerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func itemPickerDidSelectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    func itemPickerDidDeselectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)

    func itemPickerDidCommitItems(at indexes: [Int], sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    
    func itemPickerDidTapCloseButton(sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
}
```

## Explicit Types and Type Inference

#### Clarity

Type inference makes code harder to read.

When reading simple code, or code written by us, we may not find a need for explicit types, as everything is clear. It's clear for usâ€”we were there when it was written. Practices that we follow to make code more readable, ultimately is not meant for us. It's for others.

Missing explicit types may result in a frustrating experience of option-clicking variables to get their types, and creating a mental notebook to keep track of everything in the scope, especially if names are poorly chosen. You shouldn't have to option-click or jump from call site to declaration to understand most APIs.

You may have had similar experience before, if not when dealing with bad code, but when using non-everyday or custom APIs.

All it takes, is couple of extra seconds to make code easier for others to comprehend:

```swift
func extractAlbumArtFromSong(withURL url: String) -> NSImage? {
    guard
        let url: URL = .init(string: url),
        let albumArtMetadata: AVMetadataItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url).asset.metadata.first(where: { $0.key as? String == "APIC" }),
        let albumArtData = albumArtMetadata.value as? Data
    else {
        return nil
    }
    
    guard
        let imageSource: CGImageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(albumArtData as CFData, nil),
        let bitmapImage: CGImage = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(imageSource, 0, nil)
    else {
        return nil
    }
    
    guard
        let dimension: CGFloat = [bitmapImage.width, bitmapImage.height].min().map({ .init($0) })
    else {
        return nil
    }
    let x: CGFloat = (CGFloat(bitmapImage.width) - dimension) / 2
    let y: CGFloat = (CGFloat(bitmapImage.height) - dimension) / 2
    
    guard
        let croppedBitmapImage: CGImage = bitmapImage.cropping(to: .init(
            origin: .init(x: x, y: y),
            size: .init(width: dimension, height: dimension)
        ))
    else {
        return nil
    }
    
    return .init(
        cgImage: croppedBitmapImage,
        size: .init(width: dimension, height: dimension)
    )
}
```

#### Common Arguments Against Explicit Types

One of the bigger arguments that I see against the use of explicit types, are that they unnecessary, or they make code wider and harder to read.

##### They are Unnecessary

According to a linguistic theory, we as a speaker (or in this case, writer) prefer to spend less words expressing our thoughts, as it requires an effort. But as a listener (or in this case, reader), we prefer as much information as possible, as it requires less effort and decreases mental note-taking. Explicit types may seem obvious and unnecessary. But they are thre for the readers.

Explicit types do not clutter the code. How come that they clutter when types can be omitted, but don't when they have to be written, as compiler cannot infer the type?:

```swift
struct SomeModel {
    let id = 10
    let message = "Hello, World!"
    let width: CGFloat = 100
}
```

If we agree to use explicit types to disambiguate, we can maintain consistency in the codebase by specifying types even for simple expressions such as this:

```swift
struct SomeModel {
    let id: Int = 10
    let message: String = "Hello, World!"
    let width: CGFloat = 100
}
```

##### They Make Code Wider and Harder to Read

If we are worried about increasing the code width and cluttering it, then there's a simple solution. According to yet another linguistic theory, good readers aren't actually reading not only all the letters in a word, but also all words in a sentence.

I suggest, that developers have already taken this to a new level, since we don't read code in it's entirety. Code is not a poem. You don't read it from top-to-bottom in a single breath. If a function return an object that's initiated with two variables declared just above the constructor call, you will probably read this function bottom-to-up. You first notice, that function returns with a constructor call, and then you look up to see the variables themselves.

Similarly, when reading code from top-to-bottom or left-to-right, we can skip some parts. Code has patterns. There are redundancies. And our minds can fill in the gaps. Therefore, it's natural to assume that your brain will simply skip explicit types that are unnecessary for you, but useful to others.

#### Exceptions

There are exceptions to all rules, and explicit types are no different.

##### Initializers

When it comes to initializers, I follow the following syntax. Type is explicitly declared, and redundant `Person(...)` is replaced with `.init(...)`. Type on the left-hand-side of the assignment operator is consistent with guidelines.

```swift
struct Person {
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
}

let person: Person = .init(
    firstName: "Firstname",
    lastName: "Lastname"
)
```

But if you choose to, you can follow the standard syntax:

```swift
let person = Person(
    firstName: "Firstname",
    lastName: "Lastname"
)
```

##### Enum Cases

Although it's contradictory to what was said earlier (about context and clarity), I still choose not to write `enum` types when they can be inferred. You are free to do otherwise.

```swift
enum TrafficLightState {
    case red
    case green
    case yellow
}

func updateTrafficLightColor(fromState state: TrafficLightState) {
    ...
}

updateTrafficLightColor(fromState: .red) // Instead of TrafficLightState.red
```

##### Initializers as Arguments

Another example is an initializer used as a function parameter. You could argue that writing `CGPoint(...)` and `CGSize(...)` make code more clearer than `.init(...)`s. If so, you are free to follow that practice.

```swift
let rect: CGRect = .init(
    origin: .init(
        x: 10,
        y: 20
    ),
    size: .init(
        width: 100,
        height: 200
    )
)
```

or

```swift
let rect: CGRect = .init(
    origin: CGPoint(
        x: 10,
        y: 20
    ),
    size: CGSize(
        width: 100,
        height: 200
    )
)
```

##### Static Members

Same rule applies to static member calls, such as `.zero` in `CGFloat`.

#### Name Shadowing

Explicit types are unnecessary when name-shadowing.

Not Preferred:

```swift
guard let managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext = managedObjectContext else { return }
```

Preferred:

```swift
guard let managedObjectContext = managedObjectContext else { return }
```

##### Type Cast

Explicit types are also unnecessary when type casting.

Not Preferred:

```swift
guard
    let flowDelegate: UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout = collectionView.delegate as? UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout 
else {
    return 
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
guard
    let flowDelegate = collectionView.delegate as? UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout 
else {
    return 
}
```

## Trailing Closures

Type inference introduces ambiguity by hiding variable or property type. Similarly, trailing closure syntax introduces ambiguity by hiding argument name.

#### Ambiguity

In simple uses, trailing closure syntax doesn't disambiguate the context.

```swift
getUserProfile(id: id) { [weak self] profile in
    guard let self else { return }

    getPhoto(url: profile.photoUrl) { [weak self] image in
        guard let self else { return }
        
        ...
    }
}
```

However, when dealing with non-everyday or custom APIs, context and clarity is important. When using a trailing closure syntax, you assume that all closures are `completion`s, which is not always the case. In this example, functions themselves handle error cases by presenting an `UIAlertController` internally, and only call a `completion` for the callback chain to continue. Choosing to omit the parameter name introduces ambiguity.

```swift
func getUserProfile(
    id: Int,
    onSuccess successHandler: @escaping (UserProfileEntity) -> Void 
) {
    ...
}

func getPhoto(
    url: String,
    onSuccess successHandler: @escaping (UIImage) -> Void 
) {
    ...
}
```

API doesn't have to be custom or foreign for ambiguity to be introduced. `UIView`'s native animation method has two trailing closure argumentsâ€”`animations` and `completion`. `completion` is an optional parameter. In the following example, it's omitted, leaving only `animations`:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.25) {
    ...
}
```

We see lack of clarity better when using custom `SwiftUI` `View`s. Most trailing closures in `SwiftUI` are `ViewBuilder`s, labeled as `content` or `label`. However, not all `ViewBuilders` build main `content` or `label`. But this is not always the case. Some could be individual row contents.

```swift
SomeCustomPicker(
    titles: titles,
    rowContent: { title in
        ...
    }
)
```

#### Multiple Trailing Closures

Trailing closure syntax with multiple arguments adds to the ambiguity by omitting argument label for the first parameter, but not for the second. It would make sense to flip the behavior, since you expect the last trailing closure to be a `completion`, and one before that to be an unique one. Additionally, indentation and formatting doesn't follow guidelines outlined in the "Spacing and Brackets" chapter.

Not Preferred:

```swift
UIView.animate(
    withDuration: 0.25,
    delay: 0,
    options: .curveLinear
) { [weak self] in
    ...
} completion: { [weak self] flag in
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
UIView.animate(
    withDuration: 0.25,
    delay: 0,
    options: .curveLinear,
    animations: { [weak self] in
        ...
    }, 
    completion: { [weak self] flag in
        ...
    }
)
```

#### Exceptions

Trailing closure syntax can be applied for commonly-used inline closures, lambdas. Some examples are `Swift`'s own high-order functions:

```swift
cities.sort { $0 < $1 }
```

```swift
cities.map { $0.capitalized }
```

```swift
cities.filter { $0.first == "A" }
``` 

## Self-Executing Closures

Self-executing closures can be used to tidy-up long expressions and introduce clarity within the code.

They can ensure that variables won't be mutated in the later steges down in the function. This practice introduces safety within the code and avoids potential bugs. It also reduces mental note-taking when reading the codeâ€”we can know in advance that this variable won't change, so I don't have to actively keep it in my mind.

Not Preferred:

```swift
var a: Int = 3
if someConditionA1 { a += 1 }
if someConditionA2 { a -= 1 }

var b: Int = 4
if someConditionB1 { b += 1 }
if someConditionB2 { b -= 1 }

let c: Int = a + b
```

Preferred:

```swift
let a: Int = {
    var value: Int = 3
    if someConditionA1 { value += 1 }
    if someConditionA2 { value -= 1 }
    return value
}()

let b: Int = {
    var value: Int = 4
    if someConditionB1 { value += 1 }
    if someConditionB2 { value -= 1 }
    return value
}()

let c: Int = a + b
```

## Do Blocks

Much like self-executing closures, `do` blocks can break up function into multiple blocks and introduce clarity. We follow OOP, sure, but not all functions have to be broken up into 3-liners as you are taught.

`do` blocks also allow us to give identical names to two variables within the same function and avoid names like `minX` and `minY`.

```swift
func fixCollisions() {
    do {
        let min: CGFloat = ...
        let max: CGFloat = ...
        
        if
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant <= min ||
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant >= max
        {
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant.clamp(min: min, max: max)
            velocityX *= -1
        }
    }
    
    do {
        let min: CGFloat = ...
        let max: CGFloat = ...
        
        if
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant <= min ||
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant >= max
        {
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant.clamp(min: min, max: max)
            velocityY *= -1
        }
    }
}
```

## Ternary Operators

#### Ternary Operators with Short Expressions

Ternary operator should only be used when it increases clarity within the code:

```swift
continueButton.alpha = isVisible ? 1 : 0
```

#### Ternary Operators with Long Expressions

When expressions are long or complex, it's better to replace ternary operator with `if-else` statements nested inside self-executing closures.

Not Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = token != nil ? HomeViewController() : SignInViewController()
```

Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = {
    if token != nil {
        return HomeViewController()
    } else {
        return SignInViewController()
    }
}()
```

Alternately, you can split expression across multiple lines:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = 
    token != nil ?
    HomeViewController() :
    SignInViewController()
```

#### Ternary Operators with Multiple Conditionals

Ternary operator should not be used with multiple conditionals.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let comparisonResult: ComparisonResult = a < b ? .orderedAscending : a > b ? .orderedDescending : .orderedSame
```

Preferred:

```swift
let comparisonResult: ComparisonResult = {
    if a < b {
        return .orderedAscending
    } else if a > b {
        return .orderedDescending
    } else {
        return .orderedSame
    }
}()
```

## Nil-Coalescing Operators

#### Nil-Coalescing Operators with Short Expressions

`nil`-coalescing operator should only be used when it increases clarity within the code:

```swift
nameLabel.text = name ?? "-"
```

#### Nil-Coalescing Operators with Long Expressions

When expressions are long or complex, it's better to split it across multiple lines:

```swift
nameLabel.text =
    runComplexCodeToEvaluateValueForNameLabel() ??
    runAnotherComplexCodeToEvaluateDefaultValueForNameLabel()
```

## Enum RawValues

#### Common Cases

In most cases, `rawValue`s in `enum`s provide no benefit over computed properties, other than brevity.

If we want multiple properties associated with an `enum`, who's to say which one is more important and should be declared as a `rawValue`, while others as just a computed properties? You could make an argument for identifying properties, but declaring all properties as computed ones maintains a consistency.

Additionally, we can give more meaningful names, such as `tag`.

Not Preferred:

```swift
enum Tab: String {
    case home = "home"
    case news_feed = "news_feed"
    case myProfile = "my_profile"
    
    var title: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "Home"
        case .news_feed: return "News Feed"
        case .myProfile: return "My Profile"
        }
    }
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
enum Tab {
    case home
    case news_feed
    case myProfile
    
    var tag: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "home"
        case .news_feed: return "news_feed"
        case .myProfile: return "my_profile"
        }
    }
    
    var title: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "Home"
        case .news_feed: return "News Feed"
        case .myProfile: return "My Profile"
        }
    }
}
```

If however, you have to use a `RawValue`, you can always map it to a property with a meaningful name:

```swift
enum Tab: String {
    case home = "home"
    case news_feed = "news_feed"
    case myProfile = "my_profile"
    
    var tag: String {
        rawValue
    }
    
    ...
}
```

#### Codable

`rawValue`s can, or rather, have to be used when dealing with `Codable` `protocol`.

```swift
enum UserRole: String, Codable {
    case patient = "patient"
    case doctor = "doctor"
}
```

## Name Shadowing

When casting optionals, use same name to make use of name shadowing.

Not Preferred

```
if let context: NSManagedObjectContext = managedObjectContext {
    ...
}
```

Not Preferred

```
if let managedObjectContext = managedObjectContext {
    ...
}
```

## Extension Access Control

It's better to annotate members within the declaration with access control modifier, than the extensions themselves. This practice prevents possible access level clashes, and allows you to add meaningful modifiers that seem clear and intentional.

Not Preferred:

```swift
public extension SomeClass {
    func doSomething()
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
extension SomeClass {
    public func doSomething()
}
```

## Syntactic Sugar

#### Semicolons

Semicolons should not be used at the end of each line.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let message: String = "Hello, World!";
```

Preferred:

```swift
let message: String = "Hello, World!"
```

#### Parentheses

Parentheses should not be used around conditionals.

Not Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = {
    if (token != nil) {
        return HomeViewController()
    } else {
        return SignInViewController()
    }
}()
```

Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = {
    if token != nil {
        return HomeViewController()
    } else {
        return SignInViewController()
    }
}()
```

#### Single-Expressions and Return

`return` keyword should not be used in single-expression functions.

Not Preferred:

```swift
var value: Int {
    return 10
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
var value: Int {
    10
}
```

or

```swift
var value: Int { 10 }
```

#### Shorthand Generic Syntax

Shorthand generic syntax should be used when it increases clarity.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let optional1: Optional<Int>
let optional2: Int? = nil

let array1: Array<String> = []
let array2 = [String]()

let dictionary1: Dictionary<Int, String> = [:] 
let dictionary2 = [Int: String]()
```

Preferred:

```swift
let optional: Int?
let array: [String] = []
let dictionary: [Int: String] = [:]
```

#### Large Numbers

Large numbers should contain underscores to help with readability.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let number: Int = 1000000000
```

Preferred:

```swift
let number: Int = 1_000_000_000
```

#### Array Indices

Don't use low-level syntax when you need to iterate over a loop with only indexes.

Not Preferred:

```swift
for i in 0..<numbers.count {
    print(i)
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
for i in numbers.indices {
    print(i)
}
```

#### Optional Type

Since `Optional` is a generic `enum` with two casesâ€”`none` and `some`â€”there is a discrepancy in how they are used. Another syntax for `none` is `nil`, while for `some` it's "`_?`".

`none` is almost never used in practice as `nil` is an universal choice. To maintain consistency, it's better to pick either the cases, or the shorthand syntax.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {

Preferred:


```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {
case (nil, nil): ...
case (nil, _?): ...
case (_?, nil): ...
case (_?, _?): ...
}

or

```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {
