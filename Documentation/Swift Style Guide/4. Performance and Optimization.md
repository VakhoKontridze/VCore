## Private Members

All `class`, `struct`, and `enum` members that are not part of an interface should be declared as `private`.

`private` access modifier modifier improves performance inside `class`es, as compiler can check for polymorphism at compile time.

It also ensures that `private` members are not called unintentionally.

## Final Declarations

All declarations should be marked as `final`, unless needed otherwise.

`final` keyword improves performance by utilizing a static dispatch. 

It also ensures that `class` can never be subclassed, preventing unintentional modifications.

Not Preferred:

```swift
class NonParentClass {
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
final class NonParentClass {
    ...
}
```

It also ensures that in a non-`final` `class`, a method can never be overridden, preventing unintentional modifications.

Not Preferred:


```swift
class Parent {
    func overridableMethod() { ... }
    
    func nonOverridableMethod() { ... }
}
```

Preferred:


```swift
class Parent {
    func overridableMethod() { ... }
    
    final func nonOverridableMethod() { ... }
}
```

## Static Constants

It's a common practice to define constants as not global variables, but as static properties under an object:

```swift
struct AppConstants {
    static let apiKey: String = "..."
    static let privacyPolicyURL: String = "..."
    static let termsAndConditionsURL: String = "..."
}
```

If `static` constants are commonly declared within the codebase (such as UI models), there's no need to retain them in the memory. We can make them computed and optimize memory usage, without losing any meaningful performance.

Not Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home UI Model
struct HomeUIModel {
    // MARK: Initializers
    private init() {}
    
    // MARK: - Layout
    struct Layout {
        // MARK: Properties
        static let imageViewDimension: CGFloat = 50
        static let titleLabelSpacing: CGFloat = 10
        static let primaryButtonMarginHor: CGFloat = 20
        
        ...
        
        // MARK: Initializers
        private init() {}
    }

    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
// MARK: - Home UI Model
struct HomeUIModel {
    // MARK: Initializers
    private init() {}
    
    // MARK: - Layout
    struct Layout {
        // MARK: Properties
        static var imageViewDimension: CGFloat { 50 }
        static var titleLabelSpacing: CGFloat { 10 }
        static var primaryButtonMarginHor: CGFloat { 20 }
        
        ...
        
        // MARK: Initializers
        private init() {}
    }

    ...
}
```
