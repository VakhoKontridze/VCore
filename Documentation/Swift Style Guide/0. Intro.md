## Intro

This style guide aims to help improve code readability by standardizing code organization and formatting rules. Codebase that is consistent in style, will be more familiar, easier to read, maintain, and modify.

## Apple API Design Guidelines

The following is a summary of official [API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines).

#### Fundamentals

- Clarity at the point of use is the most important goal
- Clear code is better than a compact one
- Write documentation

#### Promote Clear Usage

- Include all the words needed to avoid ambiguity
- Omit needless words
- Use variable and parameter names based on roles, not their type constraints
- Compensate for weak type information to clarify a parameter’s role

####  Strive for Fluent Usage

- Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases
- Begin names of factory methods with “make”
- The first argument to initializer and factory methods calls should not form a phrase starting with the base name
- Name functions and methods according to their side-effects
    - When the operation is naturally described by a verb, use the verb’s imperative for the mutating method and apply the "ed" or "ing" suffix to name its nonmutating counterpart
    - When the operation is naturally described by a noun, use the noun for the nonmutating method and apply the "form" prefix to name its mutating counterpart
    - Uses of Boolean methods and properties should read as assertions about the receiver when the use is nonmutating
    - Protocols that describe what something is should read as nouns
    - Protocols that describe a capability should be named using the suffixes "able", "ible", or "ing"
    - The names of other types, properties, variables, and constants should read as nouns

#### Use Terminology Well

- Avoid obscure terms if a more common word conveys meaning just as well
- Stick to the established meaning—don't surprise an expert, or confuse a beginner
- Avoid abbreviations
- Embrace precedent—don’t optimize terms for the total beginner at the expense of conformance to existing culture
