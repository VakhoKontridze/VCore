# Do Blocks

In addition to self-executing closures, `do` blocks can also help break up functions and improve code clarity. While object-oriented programming emphasizes breaking functions into shorter, concise blocks, it's not necessary to limit yourself to three-line functions.

Using `do` blocks can also eliminate the need for awkward variable names like `minX` and `minY` by allowing you to use identical names for variables within the same function. This not only simplifies code but also reduces cognitive overhead when reading it.

```swift
func fixCollisions() {
    do {
        let min: CGFloat = ...
        let max: CGFloat = ...
        
        if
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant <= min ||
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant >= max
        {
            floatingViewConstraintX.constant.clamp(min: min, max: max)
            velocityX *= -1
        }
    }
    
    do {
        let min: CGFloat = ...
        let max: CGFloat = ...
        
        if
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant <= min ||
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant >= max
        {
            floatingViewConstraintY.constant.clamp(min: min, max: max)
            velocityY *= -1
        }
    }
}
```
