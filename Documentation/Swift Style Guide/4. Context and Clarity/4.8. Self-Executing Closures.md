## Usage

Self-executing closures can be a useful tool for improving the readability and safety of your code. They are particularly helpful for tidying up long expressions. Self-executing closures can make your code easier to read and understand. By encapsulating a complex expression within a closure, you can reduce mental load for readers and make it easier to follow the flow of the code.

Additionally, by wrapping an expression in a self-executing closure, you can be sure that any variables used in the expression will not be modified by subsequent code. This can help prevent bugs and improve the overall safety of your code.

Not Preferred:

```swift
var a: Int = 3
if someConditionA1 { a += 1 }
if someConditionA2 { a -= 1 }

var b: Int = 4
if someConditionB1 { b += 1 }
if someConditionB2 { b -= 1 }

let c: Int = a + b
```

Preferred:

```swift
let a: Int = {
    var value: Int = 3
    if someConditionA1 { value += 1 }
    if someConditionA2 { value -= 1 }
    return value
}()

let b: Int = {
    var value: Int = 4
    if someConditionB1 { value += 1 }
    if someConditionB2 { value -= 1 }
    return value
}()

let c: Int = a + b
```

## Alternative

If, however, you decide not to use self-executing closures, and the variable will be written to before being read, there is no need to declare it as a `var`.

```swift
let value: Int
if someCondition {
    value = 3
} else {
    value = 4
}

print(value)
```
