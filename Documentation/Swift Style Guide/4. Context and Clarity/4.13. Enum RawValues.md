## Properties over RawValues

In many cases, using `rawValue`s in `enum`s can offer no significant advantage over computed properties, other than brevity.

When we want to associate multiple properties with an `enum`, it may be difficult to decide which one should be designated as the `rawValue`, while others should be computed properties. However, declaring all properties as computed ones can maintain consistency and clarity within the codebase. You could make an argument for identifying properties, but declaring all properties as computed ones maintains a consistency.

Moreover, it enables us to assign more meaningful and descriptive names to properties, such as `tag`.

Not Preferred:

```swift
enum Tab: String {
    case home = "home"
    case news_feed = "news_feed"
    case myProfile = "my_profile"
    
    var title: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "Home"
        case .news_feed: return "News Feed"
        case .myProfile: return "My Profile"
        }
    }
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
enum Tab {
    case home
    case news_feed
    case myProfile
    
    var tag: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "home"
        case .news_feed: return "news_feed"
        case .myProfile: return "my_profile"
        }
    }
    
    var title: String {
        switch self {
        case .home: return "Home"
        case .news_feed: return "News Feed"
        case .myProfile: return "My Profile"
        }
    }
}
```

## Mapping Properties to RawValues

When it's necessary to use a `RawValue` in an `enum`, it's still possible to provide a property with a meaningful name by mapping it to the corresponding value. This approach offers the advantage of using a descriptive name instead of an arbitrary one provided by the `RawValue`.

```swift
enum Tab: String {
    case home = "home"
    case news_feed = "news_feed"
    case myProfile = "my_profile"
    
    var tag: String {
        rawValue
    }
    
    ...
}
```

## Codable

When working with the `Codable` protocol, it's necessary to use the `rawValue` property in enums. However, it's recommended to include a `rawValue` even when it's identical to the `case` name, since renaming the `case` in the future could cause problems without a corresponding `rawValue`. By explicitly defining a `rawValue` for each `case`, the code becomes more robust and less prone to errors in the future.

```swift
enum UserRole: String, Codable {
    case patient = "patient"
    case doctor = "doctor"
}
```
