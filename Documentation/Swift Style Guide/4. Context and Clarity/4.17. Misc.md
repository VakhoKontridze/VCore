## Semicolons

The use of semicolons to terminate lines is not recommended. Although it's technically allowed, it's considered bad style and adds unnecessary clutter to the code.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let message: String = "Hello, World!";
```

Preferred:

```swift
let message: String = "Hello, World!"
```

The only situations where semicolons are required are when you want to put multiple statements on a single line.

```swift
func fetchData(
    completion: @escaping (Data?) -> Void
) {
    guard someCondition() else { completion(nil); return }
    
    ...
}
```

## Parentheses

It is a common convention to omit parentheses around conditions unless it helps to improve clarity or readability of the code. In most cases, parentheses can be safely omitted, making the code less cluttered and easier to read.

Not Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = {
    if (token != nil) {
        HomeViewController()
    } else {
        SignInViewController()
    }
}()
```

Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = {
    if token != nil {
        HomeViewController()
    } else {
        SignInViewController()
    }
}()
```

However, in some cases, using parentheses can make the code more explicit and easier to understand. For example, when you have complex conditions involving multiple operators, it might be a good idea to use parentheses to clarify the order of operations. Similarly, when you have nested conditions, using parentheses can make it easier to see which conditions are being evaluated together.

```swift
let result: Bool = 
    (someCondition() || someOtherCondition) &&
    yetAnotherCondition()
```

## Single-Expressions and Return

In single-expression functions, it's better to avoid using the `return` keyword. Instead, you can rely on implicit `return` feature. This makes the code more concise and readable, as it removes unnecessary noise.

Not Preferred:

```swift
var value: Int {
    return 10
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
var value: Int {
    10
}
```

or

```swift
var value: Int { 10 }
```

## Shorthand Generic Syntax

The shorthand generic syntax, such as `Array<String>` replaced with `[String]`, should be used when it improves the readability of the code. Using the shorthand syntax is generally preferred, as it reduces visual clutter and makes the code more concise.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let optional1: Optional<Int>
let optional2: Int?

let array1: Array<String> = []
let array2 = [String]()

let dictionary1: Dictionary<Int, String> = [:] 
let dictionary2 = [Int: String]()
```

Preferred:

```swift
let optional: Int?
let array: [String] = []
let dictionary: [Int: String] = [:]
```

However, if using the shorthand syntax makes the code harder to read or understand, it's better to stick with the full generic syntax. It's also worth noting that some older codebases may still use the full generic syntax for consistency with older versions of Swift.

## Large Numbers

When declaring or initializing large numbers, it's recommended to use underscores to improve their readability. This makes it easier to read and count the number of digits, especially when dealing with long numbers or binary/hexadecimal values.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let number: Int = 1000000
```

Preferred:

```swift
let number: Int = 1_000_000
```

## Array Indices

When iterating over a loop using only indexes, it is recommended to avoid using low-level syntax such as a `while` loop with a counter. Instead, consider using a `indices`.

Not Preferred:

```swift
for i in 0..<numbers.count {
    print(i)
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
for i in numbers.indices {
    print(i)
}
```

## Optional Type

Since `Optional` is a generic `enum` with two cases—`none` and `some`—there is a discrepancy in how they are used. The shorthand syntax for `some` is the question mark (`_?`), while `none` is represented by `nil`.

However, in practice, `none` is almost never used, as `nil` is the universal choice. To maintain consistency, it's better to pick either the `case`s or the shorthand syntax and stick to within the declaration.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {
case (nil, nil): ...
case (nil, .some): ...
case (.some, nil): ...
case (.some, .some): ...
}
```

Preferred:


```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {
case (nil, nil): ...
case (nil, _?): ...
case (_?, nil): ...
case (_?, _?): ...
}
```

or

```swift
let a: Int?
let b: Int?

switch (a, b) {
case (.none, .none): ...
case (.none, .some): ...
case (.some, .none): ...
case (.some, .some): ...
}
```

## Omitting Unnecessary Associated Values

If you're not using the associated values of an `enum` in a particular scope, it's better to omit them. This reduces clutter and can make your code more readable.

Not Preferred:

```swift
enum Dimension {
    case horizontal(CGFloat)
    case vertical(CGFloat)
    
    var isHorizontal: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .horizontal(_): true
        case .vertical(_): false
        }
    }
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
enum Dimension {
    case horizontal(CGFloat)
    case vertical(CGFloat)
    
    var isHorizontal: Bool {
        switch self {
        case .horizontal: true
        case .vertical: false
        }
    }
}
```

## Enum Destruction

When you are destructuring an `enum`, it is recommended to use the `let` keyword for individual variables and not for the entire declaration. This can help make the code more readable and avoid potential issues with shadowing variable names.

Not Preferred:

```swift
switch result {
case let .success(json):
    ...
    
case let .failure(error):
    ...
}
```

```swift
guard let case .success(json) else { return }
```

Preferred:

```swift
switch result {
case .success(let json):
    ...
    
case .failure(let error):
    ...
}
```

```swift
guard case .success(let json) else { return }
```

## Lazy Variables

Lazy variables should have getter and setter accessors written together, followed by the `lazy` keyword.

```swift
lazy var a: Int = 1
private lazy var b: Int = 2
private(set) public lazy var c: Int = 3
```
