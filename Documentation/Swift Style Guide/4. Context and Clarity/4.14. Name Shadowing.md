# Name Shadowing

When casting optionals, it's recommended to use the same name for the casted value and the optional value. This way, you can make use of name shadowing and avoid creating a new variable with a different name, which could lead to confusion and errors. Using the same name for both values can also make the code more concise and easier to read.

Not Preferred

```swift
if let context: NSManagedObjectContext = managedObjectContext {
    ...
}
```

Not Preferred

```swift
if let managedObjectContext = managedObjectContext {
    ...
}
```

Ever since the release of `Swift` `5.7`, you can utilize shorthand `if-let` syntax.

```swift
guard let managedObjectContext else { return }
```
