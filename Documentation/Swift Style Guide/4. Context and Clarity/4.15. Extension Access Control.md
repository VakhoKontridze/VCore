# Extension Access Control

It's a better practice to annotate members with access control modifiers, rather than annotating extensions themselves. By annotating members with access control modifiers, we prevent possible access level clashes, and we can add meaningful modifiers that convey clear and intentional access levels to the members.

Not Preferred:

```swift
public extension SomeStruct {
    func doSomething()
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
extension SomeStruct {
    public func doSomething()
}
```
