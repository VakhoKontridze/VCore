## Clarity at the Call Site

When naming functions and methods, it's important to prioritize clarity at the call site. The name should clearly communicate what the function does and what arguments it expects.

Function names should be descriptive and concise, while still providing enough information to be useful. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that may not be immediately understandable

Good function names should help developers understand what the function does without needing to look at its implementation. This can make code easier to read and maintain.

When naming functions, consider the intended purpose of the function and the context in which it will be used. A good name should be intuitive to someone who is familiar with the problem domain.

If a function performs multiple related tasks, consider breaking it up into smaller, more focused functions with descriptive names.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func add(_ observer: NSObject, for keyPath: String) { ... }

add(self, for: "contentSize")
```

Preferred:

```swift
func addObserver(_ observer: NSObject, forKeyPath keyPath: String) { ... }

addObserver(self, forKeyPath: "contentSize")
```

## Event Functions

Event-handling functions and methods should be named in the past-tense, since they are triggered by an action that has already occurred. Additionally, the subject of the action can be removed from the name if it's not necessary to convey the meaning.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func didLoadView() { ... } // Who loaded the view?

func continueButtonDidTap() { ... } // Button doesn't tap, it gets tapped. 
```

Preferred:

```swift
func viewDidLoad() { ... }

func didTapContinueButton() { ... } // Word "user" is implied at the beginning and is removed
```

## Delegate Methods

Methods within the same delegate should have a standardized prefix to make it easier to identify which methods belong to a specific `protocol`. This helps improve code readability and organization, especially in larger codebases.

Not Preferred:

```swift
protocol ItemPickerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didSelectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    func didDeselectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)

    func didCommitItems(at indexes: [Int], sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    
    func didTapCloseButton(sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
protocol ItemPickerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func itemPickerDidSelectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    func itemPickerDidDeselectItem(at index: Int, sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)

    func itemPickerDidCommitItems(at indexes: [Int], sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
    
    func itemPickerDidTapCloseButton(sender itemPicker: ItemPickerView)
}
```

## Verbs as Nouns

Functions and methods are named with verbs that indicate an action.

```swift
func doSomething(with parameter: Int) -> Bool { ... }
```

However, when they are getters, the "get" or "return" prefix can be omitted to make them nouns. This makes it easier to distinguish between functions and methods that perform an action and those that simply return a value without performing an action.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func getTitleColor(forState state: ButtonState) -> UIColor { ... }
```

Preferred:

```swift
func titleColor(forState state: ButtonState) -> UIColor { ... }
```
