## Quotation Marks and Backticks

Quotation marks and backticks ("`") should be used within comments, documentation, or elsewhere, to denote specific types or literal values. This practice enhances readability by highlighting reserved keywords, types, or literals within a dense text block.

#### Comments

When writing basic comments, backticks should be used to represent both types and literal values.

```swift
let object: SomeObject = .init(...) // Initializes `SomeObject` with ...
```

```swift
let int: Int = 1 + 2 // `3`
let bool: Bool = !false // `true`
```

#### DEBUG Statements

When writing debug statements, single quotation mark should be used to represent both types and literal values.

```swift
NSLog("Error in `UICollectionView`. 'isPagingEnabled' must be set to 'false'")
```

#### Documentation

When writing documentation, backticks should be used to represent both types and literal values.

```swift
/// Subclass of `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` that organizes items into a grid with a flowing carousel alignment.
///
/// For correct behavior, 'isPagingEnabled' must be set to 'false'.
open class CarouselCollectionViewFlowLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout { 
    ... 
}
```

Quoted text should also be encapsulated within backticks.

```swift
/// Formats seconds as digital time using `"MM:SS"` format.
func formatAsDigitalTime(_ seconds: Double) - > { 
    ... 
}
```

#### Documentation Comments

When writing comments for usage examples within documentation, backticks should be used for types, but not literal values.

```swift
extension Bool {
    /// Returns `Bool` with a toggled value.
    ///
    ///     let value: Bool = true.toggled() // false
    ///
    func toggled() -> Bool { 
        ... 
    }    
}
```
