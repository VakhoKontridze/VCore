## Short Expressions

The `nil`-coalescing operator should be used judiciously to enhance code clarity. It can be useful in scenarios where a default value needs to be assigned to a variable or property if another value is `nil`. However, overusing this operator can make code hard to read and follow, especially when used in long or nested expressions. In such cases, it's better to use optional binding or `guard` statements to unwrap optionals and handle `nil` cases explicitly.

```swift
nameLabel.text = name ?? "-"
```

## Long Expressions

For long or complex `nil`-coalescing expressions, it's often better to split them across multiple lines to improve readability and reduce cognitive load. This can be achieved by breaking the expression into smaller parts and using line breaks and indentation to clearly indicate the structure of the expression. By doing so, it becomes easier to understand the logic and make any necessary changes in the future.

```swift
nameLabel.text =
    runComplexCodeToEvaluateValueForNameLabel() ??
    runAnotherComplexCodeToEvaluateDefaultValueForNameLabel()
```
