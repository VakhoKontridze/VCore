## Preventing Shadowing

It is not recommended to use the `default` `case` in a `switch` statement to shadow an existing `case`. This can lead to unintended consequences and make the code difficult to reason about. Instead, it's better to exhaust all `case`s explicitly in the `switch` statement, forcing you to consider all possible scenarios and business logic. Doing so also ensures that new `case`s are not inadvertently shadowed by the `default` `case`.

Not Preferred:

```swift
switch someEnum {
case .a: ...
default: ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
switch someEnum {
case .a: ...
case .b: ...
}
```

## "Every Other Case"

You can use the `default` `case` when casting to handle uncertain scenarios, such as "every other scenario". However, it's important to note that using `default` to cover all possible `case`s can mask potential bugs or errors in your code. It's always best to explicitly handle all expected `case`s to ensure proper business logic and avoid unexpected behavior.

```swift
func LOG(_ item: Any) {
    let description: String = {
        switch item {
        case let error as Error:
            return (error as NSError).localizedDescription

        case let string as String:
            return string

        default:
            return String(describing: item)
        }
    }()
    
    ...
}
```

## Enum Properties

For consistency, consider exhausting `enum`s whenever possible.

Not Preferred:

```swift
enum LayoutDirection {
    case horizontal
    case vertical
}

let layoutDirection: LayoutDirection = ...

switch layoutDirection {
case .horizontal: ...
default: ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
enum LayoutDirection {
    case horizontal
    case vertical
}

let layoutDirection: LayoutDirection = ...

switch layoutDirection {
case .horizontal: ...
case .vertical: ...
}
```
