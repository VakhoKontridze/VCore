## Arithmetic Expressions

Long arithmetic expressions should be split into several lines to make them easier to read. This can be done by breaking the expression into smaller sub-expressions, each on a new line and properly indented. This not only improves the readability of the code, but also makes it easier to debug and maintain.

Not Preferred:

```swift
let result: Double = getFirstAddendFromSomeLongFunction() + getSecondAddendFromAnotherLongFunction() + getThirdAddendFromYetAnotherLongFunction()
```

or

```swift
let result: Double = getFirstAddendFromSomeLongFunction() +
getSecondAddendFromAnotherLongFunction() +
getThirdAddendFromYetAnotherLongFunction()
```

Preferred:

```swift
let result: Double =
    getFirstAddendFromSomeLongFunction() +
    getSecondAddendFromAnotherLongFunction() +
    getThirdAddendFromYetAnotherLongFunction()
```

## Ternary Operators

Long ternary expressions should be split into several lines to improve readability.

Not Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = token != nil ? HomeViewController() : SignInViewController()
```

or

```swift
window?.rootViewController = token != nil ?
HomeViewController() :
SignInViewController()
```

Preferred:

```swift
window?.rootViewController = 
    token != nil ?
    HomeViewController() :
    SignInViewController()
```
