# Tabs

The use of tabs or spaces for indentation is a matter of personal preference. However, it's important to maintain consistency within a codebase. For this style guide, we recommend using 4 spaces for indentation, as it helps to visualize large and nested blocks of code. Additionally, 4 spaces is a widely accepted standard in the programming community. No need to reinvent a wheel here.
