# Guard Statements

## Short Expressions

For short `guard` expressions, it's acceptable to write them on a single line.

```swift
guard someCondition else { return }
```

## Long Expressions

 However, if the `guard` expression becomes too long, it's better to move it to a new line for clarity.  In addition, the `else` statement should be on a separate line, indented to the same level as the corresponding guard statement for consistency and readability. For same reason, the `return` statement is indented to the same level as conditions.

```swift
guard
    evaluateSomeCondition(withArgument: someArgument)
else {
    return
}
```

## Expressions with Multiple Conditions

If the `guard` expressions are simple and short, it's possible to write multiple conditions on a single line.

```swift
guard conditionA, conditionB else { return }
```

However, it's important to maintain readability and avoid excessive complexity. In most cases, it's better to separate the conditions into individual lines, using tabs for indentation to ensure consistency throughout the codebase. This helps to improve code clarity and makes it easier to understand the logic.

Not Preferred:

```swift
guard conditionA,
    conditionB,
    conditionC else {
    return
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
guard
    conditionA,
    conditionB,
    conditionC
else {
    return
}
```
