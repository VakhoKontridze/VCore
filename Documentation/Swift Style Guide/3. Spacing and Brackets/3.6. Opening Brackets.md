# Opening Brackets

The opening bracket of a function or control flow statement should be placed on the same line as the declaration or statement (K&R style), rather than on a new line . This helps to conserve vertical space and makes the code easier to read by keeping related code elements closer together.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func doSomething()
{
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
func doSomething() {
    ...
}
```

There are some exceptions to this rule. For additional info, refer to "Functions with Generic Type Constraints" chapter in the same section.
