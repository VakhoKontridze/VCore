## Files

Extra newlines shouldn't be added at the end of the file.

## Types and Protocols

To improve code readability, it's recommended to separate types and `protocol`s with a single blank line. This visually separates different sections of code and makes it easier to identify where a new type or `protocol` begins.

## Functions and Methods

Methods should be separated by one blank line for better readability. However, there should not be an extra newline after the opening bracket.

Whitespace within methods and functions should be used to visually separate blocks of related functionality, but it should not be excessive as it can hinder readability.

```swift
func doSomething() -> Int {
    let a: Int = ...
    let b: Int = ...
    
    let c: Int = a + b
    
    var d: Int = 0
    for i in 0..<c {
        ...
    }
    
    return  d
}
```

## Variables, Properties, and Cases

Variables, properties, and cases should be organized logically and grouped together by their use cases. This organization makes the code more readable and helps developers to quickly locate the relevant code.

```swift
final class AppData {
    static let shared: AppData = .init()
    
    @KeychainStorage("DeviceToken") var deviceToken: String?
    @KeychainStorage("PushToken") var pushToken: String?
    
    @KeychainStorage("AccessToken") var accessToken: String?
    
    @KeychainStorage("UserID") var id: Int?
    @KeychainStorage("FirstName") var firstName: String?
    @KeychainStorage("LastName") var lastName: String?
    
    @KeychainStorage("Email") var email: String?
    @KeychainStorage("PhoneNumber") var phoneNumber: String?
}
```

```swift
enum HTTPStatus: Int {
    case ok = 200
    
    case badRequest = 400
    case unauthorized = 401
    case paymentRequired = 402
    case forbidden = 403
    case notFound = 404
    
    case internalServerError = 500
}
```
