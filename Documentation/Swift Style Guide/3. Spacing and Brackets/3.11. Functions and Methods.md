## Short Declarations

In short functions and methods, parameters can be declared on the same line to save space and improve readability.

```swift
func doSomething(with number: Int) -> Bool {
    ...
}
```

## Long Declarations

However, for longer functions and methods, it's recommended to declare parameters on separate lines, as it can be easier to read and understand the function signature. Additionally, separating parameters onto different lines makes it easier to add, remove or modify parameters without affecting the rest of the function signature.

```swift
func doSomeOtherThingWithThisFunction(
    withGivenNumber number: Int
) -> Bool
``` 

## Functions with Multiple Arguments

If a function declaration has only a few arguments and is short enough, it can be written on a single line for the sake of brevity and clarity.

```swift
func add(_ num1: Int, to num2: Int) -> Int {
    ...
}
```

However, if the function signature becomes too long or hard to read, it is better to separate the arguments onto separate lines, using proper indentation and alignment to improve readability.

Not Preferred:

```swift
func doSomething(argument1: Int,
                 argument2: Double,
                 argument3: Char,
                 argument4: String) -> Bool {
    ...
}
```

Preferred:

```swift
func doSomething(
    argument1: Int,
    argument2: Double,
    argument3: Char,
    argument4: String
) -> Bool {
    ...
}
```

## Functions with Nested Arguments

If a function declaration takes an argument, that also takes an argument, argument declaration can begin on the same line.

```swift
self._object = State(initialValue: SomeObject(
    value: ...
))
```

```swift
var request: URLRequest = ...
try request.addHTTPHeaderFields(json: [
    "Authorization": "Bearer ..."
])
```

This syntax is also commonly used in `SwiftUI`.

```swift
var body: some View {
    ...
        .toolBar(content: {
            ...
        })
}
```

If, however, there is more than two levels of nesting, arguments should be moved to newline.

Not Preferred:

```swift
self._object = State(initialValue: SomeObject(
    otherObject: OtherObject(
        value: ...
    )
))
```

Preferred:

```swift
self._object = State(
    initialValue: SomeObject(
        otherObject: OtherObject(
            value: ...
        )
    )
)
```

## Functions with Multi-Line Expression Arguments

If an expression is used as a function or method argument, the comma separating the arguments should be indented to the level of the argument label. This improves code readability and makes it easier to distinguish between the function name and its arguments.

```swift
doSomething(
    a:
        getFirstAddendFromSomeLongFunction() +
        getSecondAddendFromAnotherLongFunction() +
        getThirdAddendFromYetAnotherLongFunction()
    ,
    b: ...
)
```

## Functions with Async/Throwing

If the function or a method is an asynchronous or throws an error, their signature should also be moved to a newline. The `return` statement should also be on a newline for clarity.

```swift
func doSomething<Value>(
    with value: Value
) async throws -> Bool {
    ...
}
```

## Functions with Generic Type Constraints

If a function contains a generic type with a constraint, it is better to place them on a separate newline (Allman style). This helps to make the function declaration more readable and separates the constraint from the function signature. This approach implies that no generic constraint is declared inside the diamond notation.

```swift
func doSomething<Value>(
    with value: Value
) 
    where Value: Hashable
{
    ...
}
```

```swift
func doSomething<Value>(
    with value: Value
) -> Bool 
    where Value: Hashable
{
    ...
}
```

```swift
func doSomething<Value>(
    with value: Value
) -> Bool 
    where 
        Value: BinaryFloatingPoint,
        Value.Stride: BinaryFloatingPoint
{
    ...
}
```

Same rule applies to generics type constraints inside types.

```swift
final class HomePresenter<View, Router, Interactor>:
    HomePresentable,
    SideMenuDelegate,
    ItemPickerDelegate,
    WalkthroughDelegate,
    ImagePickerDelegate
    where
        View: HomeViewable,
        Router: HomeRoutable,
        Interactor: HomeInteractive
{
    ...
}
```
