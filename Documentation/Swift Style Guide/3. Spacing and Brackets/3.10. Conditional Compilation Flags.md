# Conditional Compilation Flags

Conditional compilation flags should be placed at the top-level of the code and indented to the same level as the other top-level code, regardless of the current indentation level. This ensures that conditional compilation flags are easy to find and modify, and helps maintain consistency across the codebase.

```swift
#if canImport(UIKit)

struct SomeStruct {
    ...
}

#endif
``` 

```swift
struct SomeStruct {
    let sdk: String = {
#if canImport(UIKit)
        return "UIKit"
#elseif canImport(AppKit)
        return "AppKit"
#endif
    }()
}
```
