## Package Structure

Project files are grouped as:

- ***Services and Managers***. Services, managers, controllers, and formatters. For instance, `NetworkClient`.

- ***Views and ViewContollers***. Reusable non-scene `UIView`'s and `UIViewController`'s.

- ***Helpers***. Non-service, non-extension objects and methods. For instance, helper methods for creating `GenericStateModel`'s and `StandardNavigable`.

- ***Global Functions***. Global functions. For instance, `TODO` and operators.

- ***Extensions***. Global extensions. Methods and properties are grouped by frameworks of originâ€”`Foundation`, `UIKit`, and `SwiftUI`.

- ***API***. Objects used for interfacing from you app/package to `VCore`. For instances, `VCoreLocalizationService`.

Project incudes folder `Extra`, which contains:

- ***XCode Templates***. Templates that can be used for accelerating workflow. Currently, templates cover scenes and gateways. For more info, refer to documnetation folder.

- Objects and methods that cannot be included in the package as they require additional customization or access to `AppDelegate`/`SceneDelegate`.
