## Structure

Package files are grouped as:

- ***Services and Managers***. Services, managers, controllers, and formatters. For instance, `NetworkClient`.

- ***Views and ViewControllers***. Reusable non-scene `View`'s, `UIView`'s, and `UIViewController`'s.

- ***Models***. Reusable models. For instance, `EdgeInsets`'s and `GenericStateModel`'s.

- ***Helpers***. Non-service, non-extension objects and methods. For instance `StandardNavigable`.

- ***Global Functions***. Global functions. For instance, `TODO` and operators.

- ***Extensions***. Global extensions. Methods and properties are grouped by frameworks of originâ€”`Foundation`, `UIKit`, and `SwiftUI`.

- ***API***. Objects used for interfacing from you app/package to `VCore`. For instances, `VCoreLocalizationService`.

Package incudes folder `Extra`, which contains:

- ***XCode Templates***. Templates that can be used for accelerating workflow. Currently, templates cover scenes and gateways. For more info, refer to documnetation folder.

- Objects and methods that cannot be included in the package as they require additional customization or access to `AppDelegate`/`SceneDelegate`.

Project includes folder `Documentations`, which contains:

- Documentations and demo apps of UIKit/SwiftUI architectures

- Documentation of CLEAN architecture
